# Building Projecst

Since leaving my job, I've been building a couple of projects. Here are the tech stacks below them. Feel free to follow my journey on [@theJasonForte](https://x.com/theJasonForte) or [Substack](https://jasonza.substack.com/)

## Rely.FYI - In Progress (Oct 2024)

[Rely.fyi](https://www.rely.fyi) is an real-time SLA monitoring tool for business critical applications. I decided to build this to brush up on my Elixir skills. I like that Elixir is built on the foundations of Erlang to allow easy development of highly fault-tolerant applications. Fault tolerance is one thing that is needed when building a monitoring tool.

- **Backend:** Elixir on AWS ECS
- **Frontend:** Svelte on AWS AppRunner
- **Email:** AmazonSES

## Attach.Jobs (a.k.a. FindDevOpsJobs.com) (Sept 2024)

[FindDevOpsJobs.com](https://www.finddevopsjobs.com) is a job board developed to learn SvelteJS. I've read online that job boards are easy to build and I was looking for a reason to build something in Svelte. I'm looking to rebrand to [attach.jobs](https://www.attach.jobs) which I think is a less niche name. I've used this to try learn about SEO.

- **Backend:** DynamoDB, Python, API Gateway, AWS AppRunner
- **Frontend:** AWS AppRunner

## RunnersForHire.com (August 2024)

[RunnersForHire](https://www.runners-for-hire.com) is a tool that makes use of self-hosted runners to provide an alternative mechanism to build using GitHub Actions on AWS. This project has a pay-once fee and is built on serverless & AWS AppRunner to ensure low operating costs.

- **Backend:** API Gateway, Python, AWS DynamoDB
- **Frontend:** AWS AppRunner
